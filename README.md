# reader-bot
A Discord bot using IBM Watson's Text To Speech API to read user-entered messages into a voice channel. 
(Mainly so that i can TTS an entire fanfiction into a voice channel without the character limits of Discord's own TTS bot).

Available whenever I get around to setting up an AWS account, I guess
